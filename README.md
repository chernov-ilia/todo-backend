# To Do List App (Backend)

A simple backend for a To-Do List application built with Node.js. You can either integrate it with your own frontend or
deploy my [todo-frontend](https://github.com/chernov-ilia/todo-frontend.git) React app. Additionally, a mobile app for
Android is planned.

npm install
